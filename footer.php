<!--this php added just before closing the body and html tags is analgous to the practice of loading javaScript "at the end" for load-speed considerations.  WP can use the php below for all kinds of things such as loading javaScript.  In this case, we'll use it to load the admin bar that will run at the top of our WP site's pages-->
<?php wp_footer(); ?>
